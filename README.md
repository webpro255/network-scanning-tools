A comprehensive collection of network scanning tools utilizing nmap and scapy for security professionals and network administrators.

## Overview

This repository contains scripts for scanning and analyzing network traffic, designed to leverage the capabilities of `nmap` and `scapy`, making it suitable for educational purposes or professional network audits.

## Tools Included

### Nmap Network Scanner

```
### Scapy Packet Crafting

**Description** : Scapy is a Python library used for crafting and sending network packets.
**Usage**:
```sh
python3 tools/scapy_ping.py <host>
```
**Installation**:
```sh
pip install scapy
```
**Script Example**:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

from scapy.all import *

def ping(host):
    packet = IP(dst=host)/ICMP()
    response = sr1(packet, timeout=1)
    if response:
        print(f"{host} is up!")
    else:
        print(f"{host} is down!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <host>")
        sys.exit(1)
    ping(sys.argv[1])
```

## Setting Executable Permissions

After cloning the repository, you might need to set executable permissions for the scripts to run them on your local machine or server. Hereâ€™s how you can set executable permissions:

### For Unix-like Systems (Linux, macOS)

Open your terminal and navigate to the script directory within the project:

```bash
cd path/to/your/cloned/repository/tools
```
Then, use the following command to make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x nmap_scan.sh scapy_ping.py
```
This command changes the mode of the files to be executable, which is necessary to run them from the command line.
